The JSPM CLI is the main command-line import map package management tool for JSPM.

For import map generation API usage or in other environments, see the low-level [Generator API](/docs/generator/stable/) which is the internal import map package management and generation API which this CLI project wraps.

## Installation

The following command installs JSPM globally:

```
npm install -g jspm
```

# Commands

For a full list of commands and supported options, run `jspm --help`. For help with a specific command, add the `-h` or `--help` flag to the command invocation.
